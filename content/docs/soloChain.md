### Main interface

When you launch Solo chain, the screen will show some details about the server, and also list out a number of accounts. Each account is given private key. Having ether automatically in all accounts allows you to focus on developing your application.


There are six pages available:

* The Accounts page shows the accounts generated and their balances. This is the default view.
* The Blocks page shows each block on the blockchain, along with transactions.
* The Transactions page lists all transactions run against the blockchain.
* The Events page shows the smart contract events.
* The Smart contract page shows the smart contract whitch have been deployed.
* The Logs page shows the logs for the server, which is useful for debugging.


### Settings
You can change some features of the generated blockchain through the Settings pages, accessed by the gear icon in the top right corner.
